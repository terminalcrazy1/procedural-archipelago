# Procedural Archipelago
I was going to make a game... instead I got tied up in the procedural generation process. Meet Procedural Archipelago, my first (and so far, favourite) procedural terrain implementation.

Procedural Archipelago uses a novel (maybe...) process to generate highly configurable islands. First, Procedural Archipelago generates island centers. The number of island centers is controlled by the parameter num_clusters, passed to the gen_clusters function.
